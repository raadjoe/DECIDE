The core ontolology POÂ² (Process and Observation Ontology) is available on http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/PO2 .

An RDF sample dataset that describes one trasformation process of microorganisms is available at data/Echantillon_PO2_CellExtraDry.rdf  

The file than contains the sample dataset with the generated identity links is available in data/Echantillon_PO2_CellExtraDry_Resultats.ttl 

A text document describing the local and the global lattices with the different identity links is available in data/GlobalContexts.txt
